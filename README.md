# PhD study

This repository contains some toolboxes and code examples developed during my PhD study at Aalborg University. Its main purpose is to support my PhD thesis, but it also contains some tutorials developed for teaching on related topics. The links below display 
the tutorials via [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to ensure a proper rendering of formulas.

## Bayesian networks

- [Bayesian networks - structure learning from complete data](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SebastianGlavind/PhD-study/blob/master/Bayesian-networks/sLearn_fullyObs.ipynb). This tutorial demonstrates how to learn the graph structure and optimal discretization policy of a Bayesian network (BN) representation from complete / fully observed data, using my toolbox [*sLearningAndDiscretizationTools*](https://github.com/SebastianGlavind/PhD-study/blob/master/Bayesian-networks/Toolboxes/sLearningAndDiscretizationTools.R), which is a wrapper for the [bnlearn](https://www.bnlearn.com/) package.
